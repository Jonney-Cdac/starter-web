# What is git rebase?
    Rebasing is the process of moving or combining a sequence of commits to a new base commit. 
    Rebasing is most useful and easily visualized in the context of a feature branching workflow.
#Usage
The primary reason for rebasing is to maintain a linear project history. For example, consider a situation where the main branch has progressed since you started working on a feature branch.
